# Stick Figure Camera Thingy 

## Team Members: 
Lydia Chan
Andy Khuu

## Description: 
Stick Figure Camera Thingy is a project based on  love for stick figures and our desire to create something which is fun and interactive. The project will utilize a thermal camera from Adafruitour in order to track the major limbs of the body which through heuristic calculations will be able to draw the person in frame as a stick figure! The stick figure will act as the player who will go interact with the project through a variety of features such as picking up and dodging balls from the sky! More features to accompany the Stick Figure Camera Thingy Project to come later on. (Human Space Invaders, PacMan, etc.) 


## Hardware Required: 
* Adafruit AMG8833 IR Thermal Camera Breakout
* Monitor
* HDMI Cables

## Funds Requested
* $40(hard cold ca$h)


## Major task breakdown and who is responsible for each task



## Goals for Next Week:
3/7: Plan out foundational outline of functions and classses <br/>
3/8: Sensor Arrives. Implement I2C/Thermal Camera Drivers necessary to obtain data and visualize it on the monitor <br/>
3/10: Have heuristic functions and calculations needed to draw stick figure person <br/>

## Timeline:
3/7: Plan out foundational outline of functions and classses <br/>
3/8: Sensor Arrives. Implement I2C/Thermal Camera Drivers necessary to obtain data and visualize it on the monitor <br/>
3/10: Have heuristic functions and calculations needed to draw stick figure person <br/>
3/12: Implement optimizations necessary to demo the live refreshing of a stick figure being moved on the monitor <br/>
3/14: Have Collision Detection completed and "balls from sky" working <br/>
3/18: Pick up ball feature working! <br/>
3/22: DONE :) <br/>
